# Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
A module (class, method/function) should have one reason to change.

#Examples of Responsibility

  - Persistence, the action of saving data to a datastore (database, json, xml etc.)
  - Read/Retrieval, the action of reading data from a datastore or source (database, json, xml etc.)
- Logging
- Validation
- Business Logic / Use Case execution
